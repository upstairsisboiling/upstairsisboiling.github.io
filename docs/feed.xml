      <p>This album, Ân&#39;a Akım, was recorded and shared with the world in 2024 by a group of people who enjoy making music together in a studio in Kadıköy. The world taught them everything they know, and they, in turn, have shared some of what they learned with the world.</p>
<p>Their time spent together, without conflict or competition, revealed a sense of ease within them. Moving away from general ideas and definitions, they began to produce sounds they themselves would enjoy listening to. They created musical spaces for each other. Their music is carefree and spontaneous.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is bold, with art as its sole intention.
Can music be recorded? It is unclear, but some moments can turn into music and be captured.</p>
<p>The entire album was played, composed, and sung at the same time. This is the reason behind its existence.</p>
<p>Ân&#39;a Akım is like breaking away from the highways and plunging into the forest, setting up camp somewhere close to the city, not too far in. It is a gentle attempt.</p>
<p>released October 1, 2024  </p>
<p>Tarık Akyol: analog synthesizer, sampler<br>Onur Nevşehir: piano, synthesizer<br>Seçil Metin: vocals, trumpet<br>Atilla Ozan Keskin: drums<br>Can Kuman: mix / master<br>Hazal Günal: visuals  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is it possible to create a musical conversation in that moment, right then and there, that both the performers and the listeners can genuinely enjoy? The answer is: sometimes. Sometimes music seems to happen by accident. And in those &quot;sometimes,&quot; it is possible to hear something truly delicate and graceful. Upstairs is Boiling tries to find that resonance within and beyond. This time the great performer Melisa Diktaş dances with the crew at a beautiful rooftop, Jazz Pod at Taksim, Istanbul.</p>
